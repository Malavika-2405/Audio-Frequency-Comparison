# Audio Frequency Comparison and Voice Similarity Evaluation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares two audio recordings to determine how similar they are based on frequency-domain features.  
Instead of comparing only pitch, the project evaluates the overall frequency distribution and voice characteristics.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform frequency-domain analysis on two audio files  
- Visualize both recordings using spectrograms  
- Extract meaningful audio features (MFCC)  
- Generate a similarity score indicating how closely the voices match

---

## ✅ Key Features
- Loads two audio recordings (`audio1.wav` and `audio2.wav`)
- Converts audio signals into frequency spectrum using STFT
- Displays spectrogram comparison graph
- Extracts MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Calculates similarity score using Cosine Similarity
